# vscode-graphiql-explorer

Use [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) + [GraphiQL Explorer](https://github.com/OneGraph/graphiql-explorer) by [OneGraph](https://onegraph.com) to build your GraphQL operations + [GraphQL Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager) by [APIs.guru](https://apis.guru) to explore your GraphQL schema as an interactive graph, right from VSCode.

## Features

- Explore your GraphQL schema as a tree + edit and insert GraphQL operations using GraphiQL Explorer conveniently right from VSCode.
- Supports:
  - `graphql` and `gql` tags in JavaScript/TypeScript/Vue
  - `[%graphql]` and `[%relay]` nodes in ReasonML
  - Plain `.graphql` files
  - ...easy to add support for more languages and frameworks
- Explore your schema as an interactive graph using GraphQL Voyager right from VSCode.

## Setup

`vscode-graphiql-explorer` needs your introspected schema, either in a `.json` or a `.graphql` file. It tries to find your schema by looking in the workspace root for:

1. A `.graphqlconfig` file containing `schemaPath` pointing to your schema, like `{ "schemaPath": "/path/to/schema.graphql" }`.
2. `schema.graphql`, `schema.json` or `graphql_schema.json`.

If your schema is located somewhere other than the workspace root, please add and configure a `.graphqlconfig` file pointing to the schema as described above.

If you don't have a schema file, you can create one by running `npx get-graphql-schema http://url/to/your/graphql/endpoint > schema.graphql` in your project root.

## Usage

The extension adds 4 commands:

1. `Edit operation`, which let you edit an operation in GraphiQL. Use this with the cursor set in a tag (or full `.graphql` file) containing a GraphQL operation.
2. `Insert operation here`, which let you insert an operation into your source file via GraphiQL. Use this with the cursor set in an empty GraphQL tag, or in a `.graphql` file.
3. `Explore schema with GraphiQL`, which opens GraphiQL and let you explore your schema, without inserting or editing anything. Press "Explore Graph" button in GraphiQL to open GraphQL Voyager.
4. `Format current GraphQL block`, formats the current GraphQL block using Prettier. If you already use Prettier for formatting, this should already work automatically for most languages. But there are some (ReasonML for instance) that can't be formatted using Prettier, and this command can help there.
